The dataset is a random sample from the original dataset.\nPredictors\n\nfage: father’s age in years.\nmage: mother’s age in years.\nmature: maturity status of mother.\nweeks: length of pregnancy in weeks.\npremie: whether the birth was classified as premature (premie) or full-term.\nvisits: number of hospital visits during pregnancy.\nmarital: whether mother is married or not married at birth.\ngained: weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds.\ngender: gender of the baby, female or male.\nhabit: status of the mother as a nonsmoker or a smoker.\nwhitemom: whether mother is white or not white."
